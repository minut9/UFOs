## Summary

This website is a user friendly way to quickly search through a data set with minimum effort. A drawback with this filter is there can only be one filtered used at a time where using multiple filters to see more specific data would increase productivity. As a recommendation to future projects, the ability to use multiple filters at once would be better, as well as accessing a live data set through a newstation or a scientific documenting website that constantly puts out new data to get the most up to date and accurate information to filter through.
